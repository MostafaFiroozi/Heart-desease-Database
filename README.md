# Heart_desease_Database
This work focused on designing and implementing a system that allows the in-home and in-hospital monitoring of several biological parameters with the aim of keeping track of Heart Failure in patients. Any of users included Technical Administer, Specialized Practitioner and Patient can manage their works from profile. By such a system it is easier both for doctor and patient to be in contact with together. For instance: Patient has the possibility to insert his/her Heart failure parameters in distance mode like home and doctor can detect any abnormalities in patient parameters and in case of necessity book a visit or patient can request for a visit. We used SQL language to build and controoll the database, and Microsoft forms and Microsoft VB for graphical interface.
